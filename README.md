# Symmetricity
Dwarf fortress editor with multiple symmetries
[Keys](#keys)

## Keys
Key |function
----|--------
Arrow keys | Move around on a plane(shift to move by increments of ten), Control arrow key to move the view around the blueprint area
comma |  Move up(on z axis)
period | Move down(on z axis)
equal  | Change designation type
dash   | Change designation type
F5 | Save to a file prompted. Shift to export to a csv file.
F6 | Load from a serialized file(not a csv)
F7 | Run an efficiency analysis and generate a heatmap to show the average distance between one point and all others, save first, it has a very, very long running time, so don't do it with an expectation of editing during the process (The heatmaps are named "filename<z-level number>.ppm"
enter |  Start/End designation(can also be done with mouse) (Press Shift-Enter to start designating as a circle)
space |  Designate single space
x |  Set X symmetry at location(twice at same location to switch off)
y |  Set Y symmetry at location(twice at same location to switch off)
r |  Set radial symmetry at the cursor location(once again, toggles)

This project is going to be superceded by a future implementation that will be cleaner, faster, and more easily extensible.
